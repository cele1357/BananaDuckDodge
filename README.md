“Banana Duck Dodge” is a group project that takes on the “Bullet Hell” genre. One of the main objectives was to gain firsthand experience in applying concepts taught in our course, as it 
allowed us to put what we learned about object oriented programming in practice. Banana Duck Dodge was created in C++, and uses GLFW for interfacing with OpenGL to render, as well as handling keyboard inputs. 
This project took some self-learning on OpenGL, and we made use of resources such as Learn OpenGL in order to easily implement sprites, textures, 
and shaders.
